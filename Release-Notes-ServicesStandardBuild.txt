Release: SSB v5 GA
Released: 21 December 2017 

****************************************
OVERVIEW OF RELEASE
****************************************

Version 5 of the Services Standard Build (SSB) contains some new features and fixes.

****************************************
NEW TO THIS RELEASE:
****************************************

 - Deprecated BeanShell detection: the SSB Build Checks will now scan for deprecated
   BeanShell code against the version of IdentityIQ that is being built.  This can be 
   useful when upgrading, where the ability to automatically identify code that is 
   deprecated in the newer version of IdentityIQ can save a lot of time compared with
   doing this task manually.
 - Plugin Compiler: the build process can now automatically compile and build custom 
   IdentityIQ plugins from their source code, in addition to the auto-deployment
   functionality previously available.
 - Updates to SSB User Guide.  Please refer to this guide for more information on the
   above new features.

Bugs fixed since SSB v4 GA

 - The patchdb target was failing when the database was SQL Server


****************************************
NOTES
****************************************

JDK version 6 is no longer supported in this release.  Please use JDK 7 or 8.

To assist the SailPoint Support team, the version of the SSB or SSD used to build 
IdentityIQ can now be seen by accessing the ServicesStandardVersion.html file at the root
of the application (e.g. http://servername:8080/ServicesStandardVersion.html).  This
information is taken from these release notes, so please do not delete this file or move
it from its current location, and do not delete the html file that is generated during the
build process.  The page also includes a timestamp indicating the last time the build was
executed.


The SSB is part of the Services Standard Deployment (SSD).  For more details please visit:
